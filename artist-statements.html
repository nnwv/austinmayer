    A 2018 graduate of The Cooper Union, Austin Mayer is an artist and designer practicing at the intersection of architecture and technology. In 2023, alongside art historian Kaja Silverman, he cofounded Blue World Gallery, a digital art gallery hosted from Philadelphia, that seeks to "build something that does not yet exist: a venue for looking at art together and in so doing, remembering what it means to be together". Through interdisciplinary collaboration, his projects activate non-typical social and civic spaces such as a surfing wave created by the Mexico/ US border fence. 
He serves as an aid to the blind at Christ Community Church. An opportunity that enriches his understanding of design through navigating the unseen world.
